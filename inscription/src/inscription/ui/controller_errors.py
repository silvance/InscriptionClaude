"""Translate raw LLM exception text into operator-readable guidance.

Lives next to :mod:`inscription.ui.controller` and is used solely by
its rewrite-failure path. Lifted out of ``controller.py`` so the
pattern table is easy to extend without touching the orchestrator,
and so the unit tests in ``tests/test_friendly_llm_error.py`` keep
importing a stable path even as the controller itself evolves.

Each branch maps to a real failure mode the field has hit:
connection refused (Ollama isn't running), timed out (model too big
for the hardware), 404 / model-not-found (configured model isn't
pulled), schema mismatch (model returned JSON in the wrong shape
even after the automatic retry).

    The local-LLM-not-running case is the dominant failure mode in
    the field — Ollama or LM Studio just isn't started. Catch the
    connection refused / unreachable patterns and tell the user what
    to do, rather than dumping a urllib stacktrace at them.

    Each schema-mismatch branch keeps the raw payload OUT of the
    returned string -- the full reply is already in the log via
    ``logger.exception`` in :class:`RewriteWorker`, so the dialog
    just needs to tell the operator what to try next rather than
    paste 500 chars of dict repr at them.
