"""Export-pipeline helpers for :class:`SessionController`.

The controller's ``export_html`` / ``export_markdown`` / ``export_forensic_notes``
methods all share the same shape: ask the user for a target path,
invoke a renderer, surface the result. The actual file-dialog +
render + result-dialog plumbing lives here so ``controller.py``
doesn't grow ~80 lines of per-format boilerplate. The controller
keeps just the per-format renderer + destination-naming choice.

Free functions (vs. a class) keep the module trivially testable
without a controller instance. The argument list is small — the
controller hands over the open repository, the parent widget for
the dialogs, and the per-format renderer callable. Examiner-string
formatting for forensic notes stays in the controller because it
reads ``Config``; the renderer the caller hands in here closes over
those formatted values.

    ``kind`` is the operator-facing label ("HTML", "Markdown",

    message so the user knows which export they're configuring.
    ``extension`` and ``file_filter`` configure the save-as dialog;
    ``suggested_suffix`` lets formats that share an extension
    distinguish themselves in the default filename (forensic notes
    use ``-notes`` so they don't collide with a plain HTML export of
    the same session).

    ``on_complete`` runs after the success dialog dismisses. The
    forensic-notes path uses it to offer "mark this session as
    submitted?" -- keeps the deliverable-class lock-down flow at the
    controller layer (where it can read state) without dragging the
    submitted-marker concept into this generic helper.

    Silently returns when the controller has no session open --
    matches the menu-disabled guard the controller already has, but
    keeps the helper safe to call from any code path.
