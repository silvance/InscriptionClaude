"""Session integrity verification.

The capture pipeline records the SHA-256 of every screenshot at the
moment of capture. This module re-hashes those PNGs on disk and
reports any divergence — the simplest possible chain-of-custody
check for a forensic exam workflow. Run from
``File → Verify integrity…`` in the UI; ship as a one-click
defensibility win.

Categories of failure surfaced separately so the operator can act on
each:

- **mismatched** — the file exists on disk but its SHA-256 doesn't
  match what was recorded at capture. Strongest signal of tampering
  or an accidental edit.
- **missing** — the file was recorded but isn't on disk anymore.
  Usually a moved / deleted asset rather than tampering.
- **unhashed** — the row predates SHA-256 capture (very early alpha
  databases) or had an empty hash recorded. Reported separately so
  operators can re-hash and pin them.
