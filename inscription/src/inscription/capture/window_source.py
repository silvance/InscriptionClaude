"""Foreground-window change capture source.

Polls the foreground inspector on a timer. Whenever the active window
changes, submits a :data:`EventKind.WINDOW_FOCUS` event with a screenshot
of the new foreground. Polling is fine here — UIA window events require
per-process hooks and a 250 ms poll is invisible to users while still
catching every practical transition.

A window is identified by its native handle (``hwnd`` on Windows), not
by its title. The title changes as the user types (``*h - Notepad``,
``*he - Notepad``, …) and keying on title would produce one spurious
"switch window" event per keystroke. When ``hwnd`` isn't available (the
non-Windows stub inspector), the source falls back to title + process.

The screenshot is captured on this source's own poll thread, matching the
click source pattern.
