"""Capture event types flowing from sources into the engine.

Sources that want a screenshot associated with an event capture it on their
own thread (``mss`` is not thread-safe, so each source owns its own
capturer) and attach the PNG bytes here. The engine doesn't take any
screenshots — it only enriches the event with foreground info and, for
clicks, a resolved UI element.

Doing the grab on the listener thread is what gives clicks a pre-click
screenshot: the image is taken before the event enters the engine queue,
so it reflects the UI as the user saw it at click time rather than after
the drain latency has let the UI respond.
