"""Sink that persists enriched events into a :class:`SessionRepository`.

The sink writes the PNG to disk, inserts a ``screenshot_artifacts`` row,
inserts a ``resolved_elements`` row (when a click resolved something), and
finally inserts the ``raw_events`` row that references them.

Screenshot filenames are derived from the event's ``processed_at``
timestamp with microsecond precision. The engine worker processes events
serially and each ``mss.grab`` takes milliseconds, so two events cannot
land in the same microsecond. That makes filenames unique without a
sink-local counter that has to be seeded correctly across recording
restarts.
