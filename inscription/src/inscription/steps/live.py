"""Live step generation while a recording is in progress.

The batch :class:`StepGenerator` runs after a recording finishes and
rewrites every step from scratch. That's a great final pass but leaves
the examiner looking at an empty notes panel for the duration of the
exam. This module fills that gap: a :class:`CaptureSink` that builds
draft steps incrementally as events stream in.

Noise filtering happens here too, deterministically, so the live notes
panel shows something close to the post-recording cleanup instead of
one row per raw event:

- Rapid repeat clicks on the same UIA element merge (``ClickDedup``).
- Repeated milestone-key presses merge with a count: ``Press Backspace
  9 times`` instead of nine separate "Press Backspace" steps
  (``KeyPressDedup``).
- Consecutive scrolls in the same window merge (``ScrollDedup``).
- Clicks that resolve to UIA "Text" controls (static labels) never
  produce a step — they are positional accidents in nearly every case.
  The raw event is still preserved by ``SessionSink`` so the AI rewrite
  has full context.

What this module does NOT do is semantic intent merging — collapsing
``File → Save As → name → Enter`` into a single ``Save the file`` step
needs lookahead and language understanding, both of which belong in the
post-recording :class:`StepGenerator` and in the optional LLM rewrite.
Manual edits made mid-recording survive both passes because the batch
generator preserves any step whose ``source_event_ids`` matches an
existing ``manual_edit`` row.
