"""Helpers shared across the HTML, Markdown, and Forensic-notes exporters.

The three exporters used to each carry their own copies of the
"pick the primary source event for a step" and "render the staged
crop+highlight PNG into the destination folder" routines, which
drifted slightly (especially around what to return when staging
failed). This module is the single source of truth.

Conventions:

- ``select_primary_event`` picks the source event whose screenshot a
  step is displaying. It prefers the event that contributed the
  step's ``screenshot_id``, falling back to the first resolvable
  source event.
- ``stage_step_asset`` writes the rendered PNG into ``assets_dir``
  and returns the **basename only**. Each caller composes the URL
  against its own document (``assets/<name>``,
  ``<custom-dir>/<name>``, or just ``<name>`` for Markdown).
- ``build_event_resolver`` produces the per-session
  resolved-element cache all three exporters were constructing
  inline.
