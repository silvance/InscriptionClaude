"""Session → LLM → rewritten draft_steps orchestration.

The rewriter is intentionally a thin sequence: read events and elements
from the repository, ask :class:`LLMClient` to rewrite, parse the
response, and write back via :meth:`SessionRepository.replace_steps`.

Manual-edit preservation mirrors the rule-based :class:`StepGenerator`:
a step whose ``source_event_ids`` match an existing ``manual_edit`` row
is copied verbatim rather than overwritten with the LLM's text.

A pre-pass also handles the empty-session case: if there are no events
yet, there is nothing to rewrite — we don't call the LLM at all.
