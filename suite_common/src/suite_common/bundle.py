"""Read the bundle's `version.json` stamp at runtime.

`prepare-bundle.ps1` writes a `version.json` at the root of the
air-gapped bundle (alongside `start-suite.ps1`, `Inscription\`,
`CaseForge\`, etc.) carrying:

    {
      "bundle_format_version": 1,
      "build_timestamp": "2026-05-03T00:00:00Z",
      "git_sha": "abcdef1234...",
      "git_branch": "main",
      "models": ["gemma4:latest", "granite4:tiny-h"]
    }

When an app is launched from inside that bundle, it can surface those
values in its About dialog so an operator knows *which* build is in
front of them. From a source checkout, no `version.json` exists and
:func:`read_version_info` returns ``None`` -- About dialogs fall back
to the package version they already display.
