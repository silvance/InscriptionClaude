"""Shared app-icon scaffolding for the suite apps.

Each suite app (Inscription / CaseForge / CaseGuide) renders its
own emblem (an "I" + recording dot, a case folder, a checklist) but
the rest of the work — the rounded accent shell, the gradient, the
top highlight, the size set, the small-size detail cutoff — is the
same. That shared work lives here. Each app's ``ui/app_icon.py``
defines its own emblem-drawing function and asks
:func:`build_app_icon` to render an icon around it.

The shells deliberately stay identical across apps so the suite
reads as one family in the taskbar.
